-- Migration: 20260731220000_polymorphic_likes.sql
-- Description: Create polymorphic likes table, migrate existing post_likes and event_likes data, drop old tables, and set up auto-populating club_id and cascade deletes.

-- 1. Create the entity type enum
DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'like_entity_type') THEN
    CREATE TYPE like_entity_type AS ENUM ('event', 'post', 'comment');
  END IF;
END $$;

-- 2. Create the generic likes table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.likes (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  entity_type like_entity_type NOT NULL,
  entity_id UUID NOT NULL,
  club_id UUID,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id, club_id),
  CONSTRAINT likes_user_entity_unique UNIQUE (user_id, entity_type, entity_id, club_id)
);

-- 3. Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.likes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Create RLS Policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can read likes." ON public.likes;
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read likes." 
ON public.likes FOR SELECT 
USING (true);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own likes." ON public.likes;
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own likes." 
ON public.likes FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own likes." ON public.likes;
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own likes." 
ON public.likes FOR DELETE 
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 5. Auto-population function and trigger for club_id
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.fn_populate_likes_club_id()
RETURNS TRIGGER
